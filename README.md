Welcome to README for Netflix Clone App called CopyFlix.

The Movie App is a web application built with React, Firebase Authentication and Database, and Tailwind. It allows users to see and browse some of the most popular movies or trending ones.
They can add them to their personal list of movies, and
also delete them if they no longer like them, but they have to sign up to be able to do this process.

*Please note that the error messages displayed when encountering problems during the sign-up process may not be as user-friendly as desired. I'll be working on improving this aspect to provide a better user experience.
